# Movie Reviews Classifier
This project's goal is to create a classifier that sorts movie reviews into positive and negative.

The project uses data from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/
The information is collections of movie-review documents labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative) or subjective rating (e.g., "two and a half stars") and sentences labeled with respect to their subjectivity status (subjective or objective) or polarity.

# Project Overview
• The objective of this project is to develop a classifier that can categorize text into positive and negative reviews.

•	I compare the metrics of four classifiers: Linear SVC, Random Forest, Ada Boost and Multilayered Perceptron

•	I apply a voting classifier to best utilize all the classifier's strenghts

•	I test the model with new reviews.
